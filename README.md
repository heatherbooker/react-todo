# react comment list tutorial


I followed the official react tutorial, where you are walked through building a live updating comment feed using react and JSX.

by running a server from the inner folder react-tutorial-master, then accessing it in the browser, you can view the comment feed and add your thoughts and see them show up instantly, with optimistic posting.

tutorial found here https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html

(personal notes: i also used this project to practice branching and merging workflows - by creating new branches for each feature/major change, and merging in once i saw they worked. embarrassing admission: i did a lot of work, thinking it wasn't supposed to show up yet, because i wasn't running the server. so i went back and restarted. oops. -_- )
