# react comment list tutorial


I followed the official react tutorial, where you are walked through building a live updating comment feed using react and JSX.

by running a server from the inner folder react-tutorial-master, then accessing it in the browser, you can view the comment feed and add your thoughts and see them show up instantly, with optimistic posting.

to see my work:
```
git clone https://github.com/heatherbooker/react-todo
cd react-todo
npm install
node server.js 
```
you can use whatever server you prefer, instead of `node server.js` - see README in react-tutorial-master for options.
then open your browser and access localhost:3000 (or set up your server on a different port if 3000 is in use)
voila! give it a try!

(personal notes: i also used this project to practice branching and merging workflows - by creating new branches for each feature/major change, and merging in once i saw they worked. embarrassing admission: i did a lot of work, thinking it wasn't supposed to show up yet, because i wasn't running the server. so i went back and restarted. -_- )
