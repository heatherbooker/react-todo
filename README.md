# react comment list tutorial


I followed the official react tutorial, where you are walked through building a live updating comment feed using react and JSX.

by running a server from the inner folder react-tutorial-master, then accessing it in the browser, you can view the comment feed and add your thoughts and see them show up instantly, with optimistic posting.
